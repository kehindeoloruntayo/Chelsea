    <p>Chelsea Football Club is an English professional football club based in Fulham, West London. Founded in 1905, the
        club competes in the Premier League, the top division of English football.
        Domestically, the club has won 6 Premier League titles, 8 FA Cups, 5 League Cups, and 4 FA Community Shields.
        Internationally, they have won 2 European Cups, 2 UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, 2 UEFA Cups, 2 UEFA Super Cups, and
        one FIFA Club World Cup. In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium in Fulham with the
        aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham F.C. was turned down, so Mears
        opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the
        name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge
        FC and London FC were also considered.[9] Chelsea F.C. was founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now
        The Butcher's Hook),[1][10] opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were
        elected to the Football League shortly afterwards. Chelsea won promotion to the First Division in their second
        season, and yo-yoed between the First and Second Divisions in their early years. They reached the 1915 FA Cup
        Final, where they lost to Sheffield United at Old Trafford, and finished third in the First Division in 1920,
        the club's best league campaign to that point.[11] Chelsea had a reputation for signing star players[12] and
        attracted large crowds. The club had the highest average attendance in English football in ten separate
        seasons[13] including 1907–08,[14] 1909–10,[15] 1911–12,[16] 1912–13,[17] 1913–14[18] and 1919–20.[19][20] They
        were FA Cup semi-finalists in 1920 and 1932 and remained in the First Division throughout the 1930s, but success
        eluded the club in the inter-war years.</p>
