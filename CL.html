        <h1>Champions League</h1>
    </center>
    <p>Since their debut in 1999, Chelsea have featured 17 times in the UEFA Champions League. They have won the UCL
        twice in 2011/12 and 2020-21</p>
    <p>Chelsea Football Club has been one of the most entertaining and valuable teams in modern football, specifically
        in the 21st century. In terms of overall trophies won, it is the fourth-most successful club in English
        football. In July 2003, Russian oligarch billionaire, Roman Abramovich, bought the club for £140 million, and
        from then on, Chelsea has been considered a European giant amongst other teamsPremier League giants won their
        second UEFA Champions League title (2020-21) after edging past Manchester City in the all-English final in
        Porto. Chelsea's first competition outside of England goes back to 1958 and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. The
        Inter-Cities Fairs Cup was a competition that was founded in 1955 and was abolished in 1971. The competition was
        later replaced by the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. The purpose of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup was to promote more
        seriousness in friendly matches between clubs in different countries. Chelsea's first experience in the official
        UEFA competitions was back in the 1970/71 season.</p>
    <p>They actually had a very successful tournament that year as they won the first round against the Greek club, Aris
        Thessaloniki, they won the second round against CSKA Sofia and they moved onto the quarterfinals to beat the
        Belgian
        club, Club Brugge, 4-2 on aggregate. They won another English club in the semifinals; Manchester city was their
        opponent and Chelseas eliminated them after two 1-0 games. In the finals, they were meant to face what was then
        called the king of Europe, Real Madrid of Spain. Real Madrid was known to win the European Cup, later known as
        the
        UEFA champions league, but they were new to this competition and Chelsea used this advantage and finish the game
        after extra time with a 1-1 tie to force another final. Back then there were no penalties so the game was
        replayed
        two days after the first final and in the second time, Chelsea won the game 2-1 and received their first
        European
        trophy. In the 1971-72 season, they entered the competition again, but were not able to repeat their previous
        success. After this year Chelsea went to a drought of 23 years without any European competitions.
    </p>
    <p>With the new format in the European leagues and with Chelsea's poor performance in the Premier League Chelsea was
        not
        able to qualify for any UEFA European cup matches but they were still trying to fight for a spot in a smaller
        European competition like the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and they finally made it to the competition for the 1994-95
        season. They even went as far as going to the semifinals of the competition but were beaten by the Spanish side,
        Zaragoza 3-4 on aggregate, after winning the first match 3-1 but losing the second one 3-0 to the Spanish side.
        They
        missed being in the European competitions for another three years but they came back again in the 1997-98 season
        and
        this time they did repeat their previous success in the UEFA Cup Winner's Cup. Chelsea won the first and second
        rounds to reach the quarterfinals. There, they had to face another Spanish side, Real Betis. They won against
        Betis
        5-2 on aggregate and paved their way to the semifinal, where they had to stand against the Italian club,
        Vicenza.
        After two very close games, Chelsea was finally able to beat the Italian team 3-2 on aggregate and reach their
        second European finals in 28 years. VfB Stuttgart of Germany was waiting for them. The final match was played in
        Råsunda Stadium in Sweden and Chelsea was able to secure their second European title there, by winning the game
        1-0.
        Because of this win, they had to then face Real Madrid in the UEFA Super Cup and Chelsea was able to beat Real
        Madrid once again to secure their very first UEFA Super Cup trophy. </p>
    <p>Chelsea's first UEFA Champions League appearance came as late as the 1999-2000 season. They had quite a
        successful run, considering they were having their first appearance in one of the most lucrative competitions in
        Europe. They got past the qualifying round, and after that, they finished first in their group stage. Then, they
        finished second in the second group stage which permitted them to go to the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals,
        they had to face a Spanish club called, Barcelona. Chelsea won the first game 3-1, and their fans were
        fantasizing about being in the semifinals after the first leg. But in the second leg, at Camp Nou, Barcelona had
        a comeback and won the game 5-1 after extra times to secure a 6-4 win on aggregate and go to the semifinals.
        Chelsea’s Champions League adventure ended there on their first appearance and they had to wait another four
        years to get another chance to appear in the competition. During these three years, Chelsea appeared in three
        UEFA cup campaigns but they were unsuccessful in all of them. In July 2003, Roman Abramovich bought the club for
        £140 million. Abramovich went on to immediately spend another £100 million to buy new players in order to
        strengthen the London club. He bought; Glenn Johnson, Claude Makélélé, Adrian Mutu, Sebastian Veron, Joe Cole,
        Damien Duff, and Hernán Crespo so that Chelsea would be a championship-level team.
        Chelsea had finished their previous season in the league in the fourth position but after Abramovich signed
        these huge signings, Chelsea was able to finish second in the Premier League, and in Europe, they made their
        second appearance in the UEFA champions league.
        That was a beginning for Chelsea in the UEFA champions league because they started their 12-year run in the
        Champions League that year in. During the UEFA champions league in the 2003-04 season, Chelsea was able to
        qualify for the knockout round after finishing first in Group G of the competition and went on to reach the
        semifinals that year after beating another British club, Arsenal, in the quarterfinals.</p>
    <p>In the semifinals, they faced Monaco of France. Unfortunately for Chelsea, they were unable to win against the
        French side and lost in the semifinals 3-5 on aggregate.
        Next year, Chelsea bounced back and repeated their success in the UEFA champions league after finishing as group
        leaders, again. This time in Group H and after destroying the Spanish club, Barcelona.
        In the quarterfinals, they faced Bayern Munich, the German giants, and Chelsea had to eliminate them to reach
        the semifinals where they had to face Liverpool. Unfortunately for the London club, the Merseyside won this game
        1-0 on aggregate in order to reach the final in Istanbul.
        A final that everybody remembers Liverpool with that memorable comeback against AC Milan and winning the
        Champions League in the penalty shootouts.</p>
